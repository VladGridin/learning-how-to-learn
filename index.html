            <p class="two-columns__paragraf">Whether it's at school or university,
              the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself.
              We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly
              memorizing information so that when exam time comes around,
              we pass the test. But once the test is over, that information
              has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be retained.
              In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.</p>
            <p class="two-columns__paragraf">
              <span class="two-columns_span">Here's the real question:</span>
              does this approach of repetition
              and memorization help us truly understand the subject material?
              The academic consensus nowadays is that it doesn't.
              In fact, what's more important than any individual topic is knowing how to study,
              but for some reason, this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?</>
            <p class="two-columns__paragraf">
              Well, there are various techniques
              and exercises that can be applied to the educational process to
              help make it more efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some of
              the secrets of effective learning.

            <p class="two-columns__paragraf">Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood.
              She thought of herself as more of a humanities person,
              and not a brilliant one at that. With an eye to becoming a linguist,
              after school she enlisted in the army, who sent her to learn Russian.
              After several years of service, during which she rose to the rank of Captain,
              Barbara left the army and decided to study engineering.
              In was during this time that she developed her learning methodology as she was
              forced to reprogram her brain for a different kind of learning.
              It turns out that when something doesn't come naturally to you,
              having to work hard to gain the knowledge that other people may get at first glance gives you a deeper,
              more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.</p>
